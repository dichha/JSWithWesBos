    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; 
    console.log(players, team); 


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(team2);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "heee haww";
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players); 
    team5[3] = "cool"; 

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person; 

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes', 
      age: 100, 
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos', 
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear(); 
    console.log(wes); 

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // however this does not work since Object.assign is only shallow level copy, affects both dev and wes object
    // dev.social.twitter = "@coolman" 

    // Poor man's deepcopy method
    // const dev2  = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(dev))
